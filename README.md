# Pinball Remake

This is a remake for the original Pinball game i've made before, on ![Pinball](https://github.com/Valzur/Pinball), however i've refactored the entire way the 
game functioned:
- Added UI support
- Transition Animation
- A Particle System 
- Physics & Collision detection Systems redo
- UI overhaul

## Installation

Simply clone the repo, in the main.cpp file make sure to adjust working directory in the cd() function to your own, then run.
